<h1>Hi üòÑ</h1>

I'm Erin, an <a href="https://github.com/enaux">aspiring software engineer</a> and web developer.

üå± I have recently completed a software engineering bootcamp delivered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/hyperion-development-south-africa/" target="_blank">HyperionDev</a> developing programming skills and knowledge in Python. Some of the projects I have completed within the bootcamp can be viewed on my GitHub profile. My scores for the bootcamp assignments can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/EN23110011761/" target="_blank">HyperionDev Portfolio</a>.   
I have also found freeCodeCamp to be an excellent resource for self-taught web developers and I visit frequently! 

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open-source projects once I have developed my knowledge and experience sufficiently to be a positive contributor.
I am inspired by the open-source community and would like to get stuck in asap!
