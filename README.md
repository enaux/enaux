# Hi 😄

My name here is @enaux, and I'm an aspiring software engineer.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python as part of a bootcamp delivered by HyperionDev.

I'm also tackling responsive web development using materials offered by freeCodeCamp as self-directed learning.

I have some experience of C++, but have yet to apply it to any projects you can find here.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects once I have developed my knowledge and experience sufficiently to be a positive contributor.
I am inspired by the open-source community and would like to get stuck in asap!
